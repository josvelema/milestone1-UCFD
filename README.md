# Seldom Seen electronics

![sldmsn](readme/amiresponsive.png)

As i am also a music producer , called Seldom Seen , i was in the need of a proper website where users can find more
information about me , listen to my music and hopefully come visit my future perfomances.

## Visit the site in Github pages [here](https://josvelema.github.io/milestone1-UCFD/cd).

## 1. UX

The website is aime at three groups. The first and main group of user is people who listen
to (underground) electonic music. The other two groups are party promoters/label owners and other
producers who are looking for a collabaration. Ofcourse the user can also be someone who is a combination
of the user groups.
